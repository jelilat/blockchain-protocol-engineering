# Distributed Ledger Technology

In the previous module, we explored the benefits of distributing a system, including scalability, fault tolerance, and decentralization. Each of these qualities contributes to creating systems that are resilient, adaptable, and suitable for handling complex tasks across multiple nodes. But what if we take these principles a step further?

Consider applications where the data itself needs to be decentralized, secure, and tamper-resistant. In cases like financial transactions, supply chain records, or any environment where multiple parties need to collaborate without full trust in one another, we need a way to ensure that data is transparent and secure—without relying on a central authority to maintain it. This is where **Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)** comes into play.

### What is a Distributed Ledger?

Imagine Alice, Bob, and Charlie are avid readers, so they decide to start a book club. They agree to share their books among each other and want to keep track of who has borrowed which book, when it was borrowed, and any notes they might make about each book. They could use a traditional method like a shared notebook where each person logs the transactions, or they could use a centralized system, like a spreadsheet, managed by one of them.

However, these methods have limitations. A physical notebook could be lost, tampered with, or become difficult to access if one of them isn’t available. A centralized system requires trust in one person, who controls the data and could alter it—intentionally or accidentally—without anyone else knowing.

To solve these issues, they turn to using a Distributed Ledger. With a Distributed Ledger, each person maintains their own copy of the data. When a transaction occurs—say, Alice borrows a book from Bob—each person’s copy is updated. The entries are validated by the participants, ensuring that all records remain consistent across everyone’s ledger. This distributed approach means that there is no single point of control or failure, increasing transparency and trust.
