# DLT vs Blockchain

While DLT provides a decentralized, transparent record, **Blockchain** takes these benefits further by adding additional security and immutability. Blockchain is a specialized form of DLT that introduces unique structures to address specific challenges DLT faces.

**Key Differences:**

1. **Structure**: Unlike general DLT's shared database, blockchain structures its data in linked “blocks,” each containing a set of transactions and linked to the previous block with a cryptographic hash.
2. **Immutability**: Blockchain enforces that once a block is added, it cannot be changed, ensuring that records remain tamper-proof.
3. **Consensus and Finality**: Blockchain employs consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof of Work or Proof of Stake) to prevent malicious actors from altering the ledger, creating a reliable, final state that can’t be reversed.

This specialization makes blockchain particularly suitable for high-stakes environments, such as financial transactions or public record-keeping, where security, transparency, and trust are paramount.
