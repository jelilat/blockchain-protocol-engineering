# Why Distribute a System?

#### Scalability

Distributed systems can scale **horizontally** by adding more nodes to the network, which allows them to process large amounts of data and support many users without overloading a single node. For instance, in a scenario where we need to solve seven differential equations instead of six, we could readily incorporate an additional node into the network to maintain the system's balance and efficiency.

Here, horizontal scaling refers to augmenting the system's capacity by adding more nodes (or computers), while **vertical** scaling involves boosting the computational power of the existing nodes, such as upgrading a node's RAM from 4GB to 8GB.

#### Fault tolerance

A key attribute of distributed systems is their robust fault tolerance. In such a system, if one node fails, the other nodes can continue processing tasks without any interruption.&#x20;

#### Decentralisation

Distributed systems can be decentralised, meaning that there is no single point of control or failure. This makes them a good choice for applications that require transparency, security, and trust, such as blockchain-based systems and other Distributed Ledgers.
